# mvc-startup
MVC developed to a Startup project.

The project still ongoing, so there's many things missing. It was made based on the moment needs.

Soon will be added a version using Doctrine.

To install:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/anankran/mvc-startup.git</pre>

<pre>composer install</pre>

You will also have to use the command bellow to make composer autoload find your models and controllers.

<pre>composer dump-autoload</pre>

All objects methods are demonstrative so you can build your owns.
