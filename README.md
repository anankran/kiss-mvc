# mvc-startup
MVC structure developed to a Startup project.

The project still ongoing, so there's many things missing. It was made based on the moment needs.

Soon will be added a version using Doctrine.

To install:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/anankran/mvc-startup.git</pre>

<pre>composer install</pre>

All objects methods are demonstrative so you can build your owns.
