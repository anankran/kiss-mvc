# kiss-mvc
MVC using the KISS principle.

The general idea of the project is to build an MVC using PHP that is as simple as possible.

You have an idea to make it even simpler, or you feel that there's something you can do it to make it better? So let's do it! ;)

Next steps will be to add ORM and a template engine.

To install:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/anankran/mvc-startup.git</pre>

<pre>composer install</pre>

You will also have to use the command bellow to make composer autoload find your models and controllers.

<pre>composer dump-autoload</pre>

All objects methods are demonstrative so you can build your owns.
